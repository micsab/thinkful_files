       " 'CHAPTER I',\n",
       " 'Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .',\n",
       " \"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .\",\n",
       " \"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .\",\n",
       " \"The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .\",\n",
       " 'Sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness . Miss Taylor married .',\n",
       " 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .',\n",
       " 'How was she to bear the change ? It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .',\n",
       " 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr . Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .',\n",
       " 'Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .',\n",
       " 'Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .',\n",
       " '\" Poor Miss Taylor ! I wish she were here again .',\n",
       " '\" I cannot agree with you , papa ; you know I cannot .',\n",
       " '\" A house of her own ! But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?',\n",
       " '\" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us ! We shall be always meeting !',\n",
       " '\" My dear , how am I to get so far ?',\n",
       " '\" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking .',\n",
       " '\" The carriage !',\n",
       " '\" They are to be put into Mr . Weston \\' s stable , papa .',\n",
       " '\" I am very glad I did think of her .',\n",
       " 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .\",\n",
       " '\" Not at all , sir .',\n",
       " '\" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .',\n",
       " '\" Dirty , sir !',\n",
       " '\" Well !',\n",
       " '\" By the bye  I have not wished you joy .',\n",
       " '\" Ah !',\n",
       " '\" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .\\'',\n",
       " '\" Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !\"',\n",
       " '\" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ,\" said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh .',\n",
       " '\" My dearest papa !',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .',\n",
       " '\" Emma knows I never flatter her ,\" said Mr . Knightley , \" but I meant no reflection on any body .',\n",
       " '\" Well ,\" said Emma , willing to let it pass \" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .',\n",
       " '\" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ,\" said her father .',\n",
       " 'Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .',\n",
       " '\" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ,\" said Emma , \" and a very considerable one  that I made the match myself .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley shook his head at her .',\n",
       " '\" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .',\n",
       " '\" Ever since the day  about four years ago  that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell \\' s , I made up my mind on the subject .',\n",
       " '\" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,\\'\" said Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " '\" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ? I pity you . I thought you cleverer  for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .',\n",
       " '\" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .',\n",
       " '\" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,\" rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .',\n",
       " '\" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .',\n",
       " '\" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ,\" said Mr . Knightley , laughing , \" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER II',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .',\n",
       " 'Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .',\n",
       " 'Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .',\n",
       " \"Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .\",\n",
       " 'A complete change of life became desirable .',\n",
       " 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .',\n",
       " \"He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .\",\n",
       " 'Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .',\n",
       " \"Now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .\",\n",
       " 'It was , indeed , a highly prized letter .',\n",
       " \"She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .\",\n",
       " \"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor ,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .\",\n",
       " 'There was no recovering Miss Taylor  nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse .',\n",
       " \"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER III',\n",
       " 'Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .',\n",
       " \"Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; and by Mr . Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr . Woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .\",\n",
       " 'After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School  not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .',\n",
       " \"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .\",\n",
       " 'As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .',\n",
       " 'Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .',\n",
       " 'She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .',\n",
       " \"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging  not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .\",\n",
       " 'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .',\n",
       " 'Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .',\n",
       " 'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :',\n",
       " '\" Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs .',\n",
       " 'Emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER IV',\n",
       " \"Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .\",\n",
       " 'Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .',\n",
       " 'Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .',\n",
       " 'For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .',\n",
       " 'With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .',\n",
       " '\" Well done , Mrs .',\n",
       " '\" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?',\n",
       " '\" Oh yes ! that is , no  I do not know  but I believe he has read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of .',\n",
       " 'The next question was ',\n",
       " '\" What sort of looking man is Mr .',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " '\" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure .',\n",
       " '\" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .',\n",
       " '\" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day \\' s difference  which is very odd .\"',\n",
       " '\" Only four - and - twenty .',\n",
       " '\" Six years hence !',\n",
       " '\" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure , so it is .',\n",
       " '\" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ; I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife  for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .',\n",
       " '\" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .',\n",
       " '\" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure .',\n",
       " 'Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .',\n",
       " 'They met Mr . Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .',\n",
       " 'They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .',\n",
       " '\" Only think of our happening to meet him ! How very odd !',\n",
       " '\" He is very plain , undoubtedly  remarkably plain : but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure ,\" said Harriet , in a mortified voice , \" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen .\"',\n",
       " '\" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin .',\n",
       " '\" Certainly , he is not like Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Knightley \\' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .',\n",
       " '\" Oh yes ! there is a great difference .',\n",
       " '\" Which makes his good manners the more valuable .',\n",
       " '\" There is no saying , indeed ,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly .',\n",
       " '\" But there may be pretty good guessing .',\n",
       " '\" Will he , indeed ?',\n",
       " '\" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended .',\n",
       " '\" I wonder he did not remember the book \" was all Harriet \\' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .',\n",
       " '\" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton \\' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley \\' s or Mr . Weston \\' s .',\n",
       " 'She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .\",\n",
       " \"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER V',\n",
       " '\" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs . Weston ,\" said Mr . Knightley , \" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing .\"',\n",
       " '\" A bad thing !',\n",
       " '\" I think they will neither of them do the other any good .\"',\n",
       " '\" You surprize me !',\n",
       " '\" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle .\"',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject .',\n",
       " '\" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .',\n",
       " '\" I dare say ,\" replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , \" that I thought so _then_ ; but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma \\' s omitting to do any thing I wished .\"',\n",
       " '\" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,\" said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .',\n",
       " '\" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse \\' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .',\n",
       " '\" Yes ,\" said he , smiling .',\n",
       " '\" Thank you .',\n",
       " '\" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .',\n",
       " '\" I hope not _that_ . It is not likely .',\n",
       " '\" Not I , indeed .',\n",
       " '\" I either depend more upon Emma \\' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " '\" Pretty !',\n",
       " '\" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .',\n",
       " '\" Such an eye ! the true hazle eye  and so brilliant !',\n",
       " '\" I have not a fault to find with her person ,\" he replied .',\n",
       " '\" And I , Mr . Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm .',\n",
       " '\" Very well ; I will not plague you any more .',\n",
       " '\" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma \\' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith \\' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .',\n",
       " '\" Not at all ,\" cried he ; \" I am much obliged to you for it .',\n",
       " '\" Mrs . John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister .\"',\n",
       " '\" Be satisfied ,\" said he , \" I will not raise any outcry .',\n",
       " '\" So do I ,\" said Mrs . Weston gently , \" very much .\"',\n",
       " '\" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .',\n",
       " '\" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ,\" said Mrs . Weston , \" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse \\' s account .',\n",
       " \"Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr . Weston ' s on the subject , as much as possible .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER VI',\n",
       " \"Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .\",\n",
       " '\" You have given Miss Smith all that she required ,\" said he ; \" you have made her graceful and easy .',\n",
       " '\" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .',\n",
       " '\" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ,\" said the gallant Mr . Elton ',\n",
       " '\" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before .\"',\n",
       " '\" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me .',\n",
       " '\" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .',\n",
       " '\" I have no doubt of it .\"',\n",
       " '\" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ?\"',\n",
       " 'Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete ,',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " 'No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed ,',\n",
       " '\" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !',\n",
       " '\" Let me entreat you ,\" cried Mr . Elton ; \" it would indeed be a delight !',\n",
       " 'Yes , good man ! thought Emma  but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ?',\n",
       " '\" Exactly so  The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth  I have not a doubt of your success .',\n",
       " '\" But I am afraid , Mr . Elton , Harriet will not like to sit .',\n",

       " 'Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr . Elton .',\n",

       " \"Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr . Elton ' s seeing ready wit in her .\",\n",
       " '\" I wish we could contrive it ,\" said she ; \" but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ; no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper  no message from my father .\"',\n",
       " 'She pondered , but could think of nothing .',\n",
       " '\" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married !',\n",

       " '\" But still , you will be an old maid !',\n",
       " '\" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public !',\n",
       " '\" Dear me !',\n",
       " '\" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .',\n",

       " '\" This would soon have led to something better , of course ,\" was her consoling reflection ; \" any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .',\n",

       " \"This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ' s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs . Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr . Elton ' s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost .\",\n",
       " \"The misfortune of Harriet ' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival .\",\n",

       " \"Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma ' s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr . Frank Churchill , which always interested her .\",\n",
       " \"With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross  and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr .\",\n",
       " '\" We want only two more to be just the right number .',\n",
       " 'Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete .',\n",
       " '\" He has been wanting to come to us ,\" continued Mr . Weston , \" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time .',\n",
       " '\" What a very great pleasure it will be to you !',\n",
       " '\" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .',\n",
       " '\" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ,\" replied Emma ; \" but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston .',\n",
       " '\" Yes  I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life . She is an odd woman ! But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank \\' s account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him .',\n",
       " 'Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs . Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy  yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming . Mrs . Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : \" for I cannot depend upon his coming .',\n",
       " '\" Yes  it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs . Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world .\"',\n",
       " '\" My Emma !\"',\n",
       " '\" Oh , Mrs . Churchill ; every body knows Mrs . Churchill ,\" replied Isabella : \" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion .',\n",

       " '\" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .',\n",
       " '\" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays .',\n",
       " '\" He ought to come ,\" said Emma .',\n",
       " '\" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ,\" replied Mrs . Weston .',\n",
       " '\" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite .',\n",
       " '\" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way .',\n",
       " 'Emma listened , and then coolly said , \" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes .\"',\n",
       " '\" He may have a great deal of influence on some points ,\" continued Mrs . Weston , \" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us .\"',\n",

       " 'Mr . Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared .',\n",
       " 'Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr . Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .',\n",
       " 'He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend  her fair , lovely , amiable friend .',\n",
       " \"But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet ' s  more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint .\",\n",
       " '\" So scrupulous for others ,\" he continued , \" and yet so careless for herself !',\n",
       " \"Emma saw Mrs . Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose .\",\n",
       " 'She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr . John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr . Woodhouse :',\n",
       " '\" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .',\n",
       " 'Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .',\n",
       " '\" I admired your resolution very much , sir ,\" said he , \" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .',\n",
       " '\" What is to be done , my dear Emma ? what is to be done ?\"',\n",
       " \"His eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own .\",\n",

       " '\" Indeed !\"',\n",
       " 'Isabella turned to Mrs . Weston for her approbation of the plan .',\n",
       " \"To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .\",\n",
       " '\" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?\"',\n",
       " '\" I am ready , if the others are .\"',\n",
       " '\" Shall I ring the bell ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Yes , do .\"',\n",
       " 'And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for .',\n",
       " 'The carriage came : and Mr . Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr . Knightley and Mr . Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for .',\n",
       " 'Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr . Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .',\n",
       " 'To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .',\n",
       " '\" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .',\n",
       " '\" Miss Smith ! message to Miss Smith ! What could she possibly mean !\"',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !',\n",
       " 'But Mr . Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects .',\n",
       " 'As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied ,',\n",
       " '\" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer .',\n",
       " '\" Good Heaven !\"',\n",

       " '\" No , sir ,\" cried Emma , \" it confesses no such thing .',\n",
       " '\" Never , madam ,\" cried he , affronted in his turn : \" never , I assure you .',\n",
       " '\" Encouragement ! I give you encouragement ! Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it .',\n",
       " 'He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr . Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace .',\n",
       " 'There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of  and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself . But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER XVI',\n",
       " 'The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable . It was a wretched business indeed ! Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for ! Such a development of every thing most unwelcome ! Such a blow for Harriet ! that was the worst of all .',\n",
       " '\" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing .',\n",
       " 'How she could have been so deceived ! He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet  never !',\n",
       " 'The picture ! How eager he had been about the picture ! and the charade ! and an hundred other circumstances ; how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet .',\n",
       " \"Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ' s friend .\",\n",
       " 'To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .',\n",
       " \"Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr . Elton ' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion .\",\n",
       " 'But  that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him ! should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind ! look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her ! It was most provoking .',\n",
       " 'Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .',\n",
       " 'The first error and the worst lay at her door .',\n",
       " '\" Here have I ,\" said she , \" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .',\n",
       " 'She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be .',\n",
       " \"To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .\",\n",
       " 'Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .',\n",
       " \"It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him  that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive  and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .\",\n",
       " 'These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .',\n",
       " 'The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .',\n",
       " 'It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,',\n",
       " '\" Ah !',\n",
       " 'These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER XVII',\n",
       " 'Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield .',\n",
       " 'The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr . Elton to Mr . Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr . Elton \\' s best compliments , \" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr . Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense  and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them .\"',\n",
       " 'Emma was most agreeably surprized . Mr .',\n",
       " 'It did , however . Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .',\n",
       " 'She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .',\n",
       " \"The confession completely renewed her first shame  and the sight of Harriet ' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .\",\n",
       " 'Harriet bore the intelligence very well  blaming nobody  and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .',\n",
       " \"Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .\",\n",
       " \"Her tears fell abundantly  but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ' s eyes  and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding  really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two  and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .\",\n",
       " 'It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .',\n",
       " \"Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .\",\n",
       " 'Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .',\n",
       " \"If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .\",\n",
       " 'Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .',\n",
       " \"Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER XVIII',\n",
       " 'Mr . Frank Churchill did not come .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed  much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .',\n",
       " 'These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .',\n",
       " \"Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr . Frank Churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls .\",\n",
       " 'She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .',\n",
       " '\" The Churchills are very likely in fault ,\" said Mr . Knightley , coolly ; \" but I dare say he might come if he would .\"',\n",

       " '\" He is a person I never think of from one month \\' s end to another ,\" said Mr . Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry .',\n",
       " 'To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another .',\n",

       " 'But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .',\n",
       " 'The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible .',\n",
       " \"Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history .\",\n",
       " \"The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .\",\n",
       " 'This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .',\n",
       " 'The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .',\n",
       " 'With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .',\n",
       " 'Emma was sorry ; to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months ! to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !',\n",
       " \"It was a dislike so little just  every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .\",\n",
       " 'In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .',\n",
       " 'Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .',\n",
       " 'These were charming feelings  but not lasting .',\n",
       " 'If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing .',\n",

       " 'Emma could not forgive her ; but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr . Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr . Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma .',\n",

       " \"The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs .

       " 'Mr . Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight .',\n",
       " 'There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed .',\n",
       " \"Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .\",\n",
       " 'This was the occurrence : The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people  friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .',\n",
       " 'But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected .',\n",
       " 'It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that \" of course it must be declined ,\" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .',\n",
       " 'She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party .',\n",
       " '\" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ,\" said he \" I never was .',\n",
       " '\" Well , sir ,\" cried Mr . Weston , \" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it .\"',\n",
       " \"But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr . Woodhouse ' s agitation .\",\n",
       " 'With this treatment , Mr . Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual .',\n",
       " '\" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible .',\n",
       " '\" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " '\" But , my dear sir ,\" cried Mr . Weston , \" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party .\"',\n",
       " '\" And no great harm if it does ,\" said Mr . Woodhouse .',\n",
       " '\" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles .',\n",
       " '\" No , upon no account in the world , Mr . Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me .',\n",
       " '\" Oh yes , papa .',\n",
       " 'He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER VIII',\n",
       " \"Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs . Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr . Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .\",\n",
       " 'He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done .',\n",
       " '\" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .',\n",
       " 'With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .',\n",
       " \"She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr . Cole ' s ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr . Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr . Cole .\",\n",
       " \"Her father ' s comfort was amply secured , Mrs . Bates as well as Mrs . Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal . She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .\",\n",
       " \"She followed another carriage to Mr . Cole ' s door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr . Knightley ' s ; for Mr . Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma ' s opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey .\",\n",

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",
