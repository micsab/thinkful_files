      "['[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]', 'VOLUME I', 'CHAPTER I', 'Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .', \"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .\", \"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .\", \"The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .\", 'Sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness . Miss Taylor married .', 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .', 'How was she to bear the change ? It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .', 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr . Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .', 'Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .', 'Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .', '\" Poor Miss Taylor ! I wish she were here again .', '\" I cannot agree with you , papa ; you know I cannot .', '\" A house of her own ! But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?', '\" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us ! We shall be always meeting !', '\" My dear , how am I to get so far ?', '\" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking .', '\" The carriage !', '\" They are to be put into Mr . Weston \\' s stable , papa .', '\" I am very glad I did think of her .', 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .', \"Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .\", '\" Not at all , sir .', '\" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .', '\" Dirty , sir !', '\" Well !', '\" By the bye  I have not wished you joy .', '\" Ah !', '\" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .\\'', '\" Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !\"', '\" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ,\" said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh .', '\" My dearest papa !', 'Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .', '\" Emma knows I never flatter her ,\" said Mr . Knightley , \" but I meant no reflection on any body .', '\" Well ,\" said Emma , willing to let it pass \" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .', '\" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ,\" said her father .', 'Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .', '\" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ,\" said Emma , \" and a very considerable one  that I made the match myself .', 'Mr . Knightley shook his head at her .', '\" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .', '\" Ever since the day  about four years ago  that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell \\' s , I made up my mind on the subject .', '\" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,\\'\" said Mr . Knightley .', '\" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ? I pity you . I thought you cleverer  for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .', '\" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .', '\" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,\" rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .', '\" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .', '\" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .', '\" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ,\" said Mr . Knightley , laughing , \" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .', 'CHAPTER II', 'Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .', 'Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .', 'Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .', \"Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .\", 'A complete change of life became desirable .', 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .', \"He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .\", 'Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .', \"Now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .\", 'It was , indeed , a highly prized letter .', \"She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .\", \"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor ,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .\", 'There was no recovering Miss Taylor  nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse .', \"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it .\", 'CHAPTER III', 'Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .', \"Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; and by Mr . Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr . Woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .\", 'After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .', 'Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .', 'Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School  not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .', \"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .\", 'As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .', 'Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .', 'She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .', \"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging  not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .\", 'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .', 'Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .', 'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :', '\" Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs .', 'Emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .', 'CHAPTER IV', \"Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .\", 'Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .', 'Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .', 'Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .', 'For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .', 'With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .', '\" Well done , Mrs .', '\" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .', '\" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?', '\" Oh yes ! that is , no  I do not know  but I believe he has read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of .', 'The next question was ', '\" What sort of looking man is Mr .', '\" Oh !', '\" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .', '\" To be sure .', '\" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .', '\" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day \\' s difference  which is very odd .\"', '\" Only four - and - twenty .', '\" Six years hence !', '\" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence .', '\" To be sure , so it is .', '\" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ; I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife  for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .', '\" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .', '\" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .', '\" To be sure .', 'Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .', 'They met Mr . Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .', 'They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .', '\" Only think of our happening to meet him ! How very odd !', '\" He is very plain , undoubtedly  remarkably plain : but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility .', '\" To be sure ,\" said Harriet , in a mortified voice , \" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen .\"', '\" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin .', '\" Certainly , he is not like Mr . Knightley .', '\" Mr . Knightley \\' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .', '\" Oh yes ! there is a great difference .', '\" Which makes his good manners the more valuable .', '\" There is no saying , indeed ,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly .', '\" But there may be pretty good guessing .', '\" Will he , indeed ?', '\" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended .', '\" I wonder he did not remember the book \" was all Harriet \\' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .', '\" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton \\' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley \\' s or Mr . Weston \\' s .', 'She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .', \"Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .\", \"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .\", 'CHAPTER V', '\" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs . Weston ,\" said Mr . Knightley , \" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing .\"', '\" A bad thing !', '\" I think they will neither of them do the other any good .\"', '\" You surprize me !', '\" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle .\"', '\" Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject .', '\" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .', '\" I dare say ,\" replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , \" that I thought so _then_ ; but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma \\' s omitting to do any thing I wished .\"', '\" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,\" said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .', '\" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse \\' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .', '\" Yes ,\" said he , smiling .', '\" Thank you .', '\" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .', '\" I hope not _that_ . It is not likely .', '\" Not I , indeed .', '\" I either depend more upon Emma \\' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .', '\" Oh !', '\" Pretty !', '\" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .', '\" Such an eye ! the true hazle eye  and so brilliant !', '\" I have not a fault to find with her person ,\" he replied .', '\" And I , Mr . Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm .', '\" Very well ; I will not plague you any more .', '\" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma \\' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith \\' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .', '\" Not at all ,\" cried he ; \" I am much obliged to you for it .', '\" Mrs . John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister .\"', '\" Be satisfied ,\" said he , \" I will not raise any outcry .', '\" So do I ,\" said Mrs . Weston gently , \" very much .\"', '\" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .', '\" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ,\" said Mrs . Weston , \" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse \\' s account .', \"Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr . Weston ' s on the subject , as much as possible .\", 'CHAPTER VI', \"Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .\", '\" You have given Miss Smith all that she required ,\" said he ; \" you have made her graceful and easy .', '\" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .', '\" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ,\" said the gallant Mr . Elton ', '\" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before .\"', '\" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me .', '\" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .', '\" I have no doubt of it .\"', '\" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ?\"', 'Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete ,', '\" Oh !', 'No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed ,', '\" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !', '\" Let me entreat you ,\" cried Mr . Elton ; \" it would indeed be a delight !', 'Yes , good man ! thought Emma  but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ?', '\" Exactly so  The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth  I have not a doubt of your success .', '\" But I am afraid , Mr . Elton , Harriet will not like to sit .', '\" Oh !', 'Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others .', 'There was merit in every drawing  in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .', '\" No great variety of faces for you ,\" said Emma .', 'Mr . Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , \" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe .', 'She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait .', 'The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist .', '\" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed !', 'Mr . Elton was only too happy .', \"The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on .\", 'Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr . Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .', '\" By all means .', 'The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy .', '\" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,\" observed Mrs . Weston to him  not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .\" The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .', '\" Do you think so ?\"', '\" You have made her too tall , Emma ,\" said Mr . Knightley .', 'Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,', '\" Oh no !', '\" It is very pretty ,\" said Mr . Woodhouse .', '\" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .', '\" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear .\"', '\" You , sir , may say any thing ,\" cried Mr . Elton , \" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !', 'The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties .', '\" He was too good ! she could not endure the thought ! she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,\" brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances , and a very few minutes settled the business .', 'Mr . Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .', '\" What a precious deposit !\"', '\" This man is almost too gallant to be in love ,\" thought Emma .', 'CHAPTER VII', \"The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .\", '\" Upon my word ,\" she cried , \" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking .', '\" Will you read the letter ?\"', 'Emma was not sorry to be pressed .', '\" Yes , indeed , a very good letter ,\" replied Emma rather slowly \" so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him .', '\" Well ,\" said the still waiting Harriet ;\" well  and  and what shall I do ?\"', '\" What shall you do !', '\" Yes .\"', '\" But what are you in doubt of ?', '\" Yes .', '\" Oh no , no !', '\" You think I ought to refuse him then ,\" said Harriet , looking down .', '\" Ought to refuse him !', 'Harriet was silent .', '\" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect .\"', '\" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean  What shall I do ?', '\" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet .', '\" I had no notion that he liked me so very much ,\" said Harriet , contemplating the letter .', '\" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him .', '\" Oh !', '\" Not for the world ,\" said Emma , smiling graciously , \" would I advise you either way .', 'The symptoms were favourable . Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .', '\" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind  to refuse Mr . Martin .', '\" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought .', 'Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .', '\" You could not have visited me !\"', '\" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .', '\" Dear me ! How should I ever have borne it !', '\" Dear affectionate creature ! _You_ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm ! _You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life !', '\" I do not think he is conceited either , in general ,\" said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; \" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for  but that is quite a different thing from  and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should  and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people  and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable .', '\" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend .', '\" Oh no ; and it is but a short letter too .\"', 'Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a \" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter .\"', '\" Oh !', 'Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence .', 'This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent .', '\" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again ,\" was said in rather a sorrowful tone .', '\" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet .', '\" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield .\"', 'Some time afterwards it was , \" I think Mrs . Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened .', '\" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet .', 'Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much .', '\" Now he has got my letter ,\" said she softly .', '\" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ,\" cried Emma .', '\" My picture ! But he has left my picture in Bond - street .\"', '\" Has he so ! Then I know nothing of Mr . Elton .', 'Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .', 'CHAPTER VIII', 'Harriet slept at Hartfield that night .', 'While she was gone , Mr . Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr . Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr . Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr . Knightley for that purpose .', '\" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr .

Goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards  as if quite another subject ,\", '\" It is so cold , so very cold  and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day  and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .', 'Mr . Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her \\' s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ; but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \" very cold , certainly very cold ,\" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening .', '\" You do quite right ,\" said she ;\" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .', \"But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr .

After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind ! Most strange indeed ! But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination  such a passion for dining out  a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it  and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .', \"Soon afterwards Mr . Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs . Goddard ' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour .\", 'After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with ', '\" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr .

Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it .', 'Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .', '\" A man ,\" said he , \" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .', 'Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the \" Very true , my love ,\" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .', 'They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr .

Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose .\", 'She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr .

Woodhouse :', '\" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .', 'Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .', '\" I admired your resolution very much , sir ,\" said he , \" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon .', 'Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .', '\" What is to be done , my dear Emma ? what is to be done ?\"', \"His eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own .\", '\" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ,\" said she ; \" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .', '\" Indeed !\"', 'Isabella turned to Mrs . Weston for her approbation of the plan .', \"To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .\", '\" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?\"', '\" I am ready , if the others are .\"', '\" Shall I ring the bell ?\"', '\" Yes , do .\"', 'And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for .', 'The carriage came : and Mr .

Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for .', 'Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr . Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .', 'To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .', '\" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .', '\" Miss Smith ! message to Miss Smith ! What could she possibly mean !\"', '\" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !', 'But Mr . Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects .', 'As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied ,', '\" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer .', '\" Good Heaven !\"', 'It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this  which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost .', '\" Charming Miss Woodhouse !', '\" No , sir ,\" cried Emma , \" it confesses no such thing .', '\" Never , madam ,\" cried he , affronted in his turn : \" never , I assure you .', '\" Encouragement ! I give you encouragement ! Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it .', 'He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr . Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace .', 'There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of  and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself . But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .', 'CHAPTER XVI', 'The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .

How eager he had been about the picture ! and the charade ! and an hundred other circumstances ; how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet .', \"Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ' s friend .\", 'To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .', \"Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr . Elton ' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion .\", 'But  that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him ! should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind ! look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her ! It was most provoking .', 'Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .', 'The first error and the worst lay at her door .', '\" Here have I ,\" said she , \" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .', 'She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be .', \"To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .\", 'Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .', \"It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him  that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive  and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .\", 'These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .', 'The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .', 'It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,', '\" Ah !', 'These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield .', 'CHAPTER XVII', 'Mr . and Mrs .

Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .\", 'Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .', \"If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .\", 'Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .', \"Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs .

Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been . Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .', 'It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .

And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not . It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two  or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .\", 'Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .

Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .', 'He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .', '_Her_ change was equal . This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust . On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill . He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .', 'He had found her agitated and low . Frank Churchill was a villain . He heard her declare that she had never loved him .', 'CHAPTER XIV', 'What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out ! she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ; she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .', 'They sat down to tea  the same party round the same table  how often it had been collected ! and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun ! But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .', 'Poor Mr . Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride . Could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr . Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .', \"As long as Mr . Knightley remained with them , Emma ' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued  and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy .\", 'She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .', 'He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls  a very thick letter ; she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .

Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early .', 'CHAPTER XVI', 'It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .', 'Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate . It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .', \"She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella ' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .

Goddard ' s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .\", 'She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .', 'She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .

The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name . She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible . No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , \" Beg her to walk up ;\" and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .

Weston ' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl .\", '\" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ,\" she continued \" like La Baronne d \\' Almane on La Comtesse d \\' Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis \\' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan .\"', '\" That is ,\" replied Mr . Knightley , \" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .', '\" Poor child !\"', '\" Nothing very bad . The fate of thousands .', 'Emma laughed , and replied : \" But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people .', '\" Do you ? I have no doubt .', '\" I am sure you were of use to me ,\" cried Emma .', '\" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks ` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor \\' s leave \\' something which , you knew , I did not approve .', '\" What an amiable creature I was ! No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance .\"', '\"` Mr .', '\" I remember once calling you ` George ,\\' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago .', '\" And cannot you call me ` George \\' now ?\"', '\" Impossible ! I never can call you any thing but ` Mr .', 'Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies  her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject . She could not enter on it . Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .', 'Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before . Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .', '\" John does not even mention your friend ,\" said Mr . Knightley .', 'It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .', '\" John enters like a brother into my happiness ,\" continued Mr . Knightley , \" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise .', '\" He writes like a sensible man ,\" replied Emma , when she had read the letter .', '\" My Emma , he means no such thing .', '\" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two ,\" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile \" much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject .\"', '\" Emma , my dear Emma \"', '\" Oh !\"', '\" Ah !\"', '\" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying .', '\" Yes , yes  but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings .', \"The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried .\", 'Poor man ! it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .', \"Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest . To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion . They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light  first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one  well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind . It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other  in another year or two , perhaps  it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .\", 'Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event . She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost . She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago . How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !', 'Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .', 'The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and Mr . Weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind . He saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it .', '\" It is to be a secret , I conclude ,\" said he .', 'He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point .', 'In general , it was a very well approved match .', 'CHAPTER XVIII', 'Time passed on .', '\" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news .\"', '\" Good or bad ?\"', '\" I do not know which it ought to be called .\"', '\" Oh !', '\" I am afraid ,\" said he , composing his features , \" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it .\"', '\" Indeed !', '\" There is one subject ,\" he replied , \" I hope but one , on which we do not think alike .\"', 'Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .', '\" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?\"', '\" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me .\"', '\" You are prepared for the worst , I see  and very bad it is .', 'Emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared  and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , \" No , this is impossible !\"', '\" It is so , indeed ,\" continued Mr . Knightley ; \" I have it from Robert Martin himself .', 'She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .', '\" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared . I wish our opinions were the same .', '\" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ,\" she replied , exerting herself .', '\" I mean that he has done it ,\" answered Mr . Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , \" and been accepted .\"', '\" Good God !\"', '\" It is a very simple story .', 'He stopped . Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply .', '\" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected .', 'He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly  she did  cheerfully answering ,', '\" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match .', '\" You ought to know your friend best ,\" replied Mr . Knightley ; \" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her .\"', 'Emma could not help laughing as she answered , \" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do . But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .', 'The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr . Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma \\' s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet \\' s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , \" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin ,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature .', '\" Do you dare say this ?\"', '\" Oh !', '\" I am quite sure ,\" he replied , speaking very distinctly , \" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .', '\" I am perfectly satisfied ,\" replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , \" and most sincerely wish them happy .\"', '\" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before .\"', '\" I hope so  for at that time I was a fool .\"', '\" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet \\' s good qualities .', '\" Me !\"', 'She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .', 'Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father .', \"Her father ' s business was to announce James ' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .\", 'The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .', 'Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .', 'Now there would be pleasure in her returning  Every thing would be a pleasure .', 'High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr . Knightley would soon be over .', 'In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs . Weston would be disappointed .', 'They arrived . Mrs .', '\" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax ,\" said Mrs . Weston .', 'In half a minute they were in the room .', '\" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs . Weston \\' s letters .', '\" No , indeed ,\" cried Emma , most happy to begin , \" not in the least .', 'He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness .', '\" Is not she looking well ?\"', 'But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon . Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing .', '\" I can never think of it ,\" she cried , \" without extreme shame .\"', '\" The shame ,\" he answered , \" is all mine , or ought to be .', '\" I never had the smallest , I assure you .\"', '\" That appears quite wonderful .', '\" It is not now worth a regret ,\" said Emma .', '\" I have some hope ,\" resumed he , \" of my uncle \\' s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her .', 'Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried ,', '\" Ah !', 'Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were ,', '\" Did you ever see such a skin ? such smoothness !', '\" I have always admired her complexion ,\" replied Emma , archly ; \" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ? When we first began to talk of her . Have you quite forgotten ?\"', '\" Oh !', 'But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying ,', '\" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all . I am sure you had . I am sure it was a consolation to you .\"', '\" Oh !', '\" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth .', 'He bowed .', '\" If not in our dispositions ,\" she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , \" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own .\"', '\" True , true ,\" he answered , warmly .', '\" Very beautiful , indeed ,\" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out ,', '\" How delighted I am to see you again !', \"The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well .\", 'Frank Churchill caught the name .', '\" Perry !\"', \"Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf .\", '\" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !\"', 'Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice ,', '\" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me ! They _will_ sometimes obtrude  but how you can court them !\"', \"He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma ' s feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr . Knightley ' s high superiority of character .\", 'CHAPTER XIX', 'If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr . Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty .', \"Harriet was a little distressed  did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ' s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations . Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley ' s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight .\", \"The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so . Harriet ' s parentage became known .\", \"No objection was raised on the father ' s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend .\", 'Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted . The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .', 'Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr . Elton as he stood before them , could impair . Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr . Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself . Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married .', 'Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells . The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .', 'The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr .', 'When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless . A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain . He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it  a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation .', \"In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way . Mrs . Weston ' s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys  evidently by the ingenuity of man .\", 'The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day  and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .', 'The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs . Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .\" Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business ! Selina would stare when she heard of it .\"', 'FINIS']\n"

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",
