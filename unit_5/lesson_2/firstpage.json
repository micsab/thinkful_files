We decided we wanted to purchase a drink from a vender and we were patiently waiting in line on one side and there was one man in front of us. Another man walked up and went straight to the counter; he walked right past us like we were statues. The bartender looked at us and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d The bartender was a male in his early 40s. The man who approached the counter was a businessman in a suit who looked presentable. The bartender ignored us (even though we were clearly in line first) and served the businessman before attending to our order. The bartender was expecting a higher \u2018tip\u2019 from this businessman because he was a successful looking male and he did not want to serve four mid-twenty females first whom he did not think would give him gratuity. Little did he know, my friends and I work as bartenders and servers who tip generously. This man discriminated us because we were a younger group of females and he stereotyped us on what we look like and how society views male and female."], "tags": ["bartender", "Public space", "stereotype"]},

Everyone was getting horrendously drunk, and although I was cautiously avoiding the punch, the cider was very strong and I could feel myself getting dizzy, light headed: drunk. On the way to the club, a boy starts to loll around, and does the \u2018I\u2019m-far-too-drunk-to-support-my-own-body-weight\u2019 arms hanging over random people\u2019s shoulders kinda thing.

And I\u2019m uncomfortable as it is, random man touching me awkwardly kinda vibe. But then takes his arm off the other girl and grips the hand of the arm around my shoulder \u2013 which is now around my neck. And he strangles me.  He\u2019s talking about his martial arts skills \u2018hey look strangle hold lol\u2019 and I can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s cutting off the blood supply to my brain and I can\u2019t breathe and no one in the group around us is doing anything and I CAN\u2019T BREATHE. He stops and it\u2019s all jokey jokey lmao, look at that he just strangled that random girl. ME.
