We didn\u2019t look back to see if the man had registered it or if he even understood English. Somehow in that moment, it was enough that we had said it and put it out there.. however, this openness and confidence took a backseat..I felt like I couldn\u2019t be open or confident enough to express me feelings about sex the more I grew older.. the boys grew more sexually explicit, of course- like sex IS their thing. I understand now that this has to do with messages they receive from the media around and porn, which is solely created to cater to male fanatasies etc.- It is NOT sex education, like I\u2019ve heard one of my classmates claim. It excludes the feminine aspects of sex completely .Girls also grow more silent because it happens too often and we don\u2019t feel safe enough to address / confront the boys/ men who do cross the line. I thought there was no way to traverse the world unless I normalized such behavior (as I saw my elders and peers do )- laugh it off when male classmates objectify girls, even yourself or discuss very proudly porn movies they discovered and shared with each other.

Of course not\u2019. . On the streets, in workplaces ( I work as an architect a male dominated industry ), grocery stores, airports, buses, markets \u2013 ai, as well as many other women, get the sense that we are being scrutinized and objectified and there is a very palpable layer of perversion to it. They are not simply appreciating us for being beautiful ( that some men and women claim to normalize such behavior ) but really sexualise us in their minds because society freely allows them to do and because they feel more (perversely) powerful by doing it. Gloria Steinem says that sexual violence has nothing to do with sex but the need for domination. And in truth, these men must be highly insecure and powerless that the only way they can get a remote sense of power is by sexualising an unsuspecting girl and throwing her off guard. Just today, I went to a xerox store to take some prints for my art class ( I teach art for special kids ).

There is so much going on in the news with sexual harassment..this is nothing but the male ego\u2019 They were raw, disjointed sentences but I felt the power in them..I was shaking as these words were coming from places deep within me.

When we hear about such subtle instances of sexual harassment it is very easy to assume we would\u2019ve done something about it. It is only when you are in such situations is when you realize how easy it is to go blank and not know what to say or do or to decide if it is even worth creating a fuss about. ", "Not that instances like these are uncommon. It happens all the time. It makes me furious and eventually I forget about it.  But that was way before I let myself accept that its normal. Because we are so conditioned to not reacting in any way it is difficult to do that all of a sudden. But we can get better. And now I will be more confident if I ever have to face something like this again. I forgive myself for today. But I will be better tomorrow"], "tags": ["market", "Public space"]},
